# Minesweeper Game

In this project, I implemented the popular [Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) game in Python. If you look forward to play this game but don't know how it works, I recommend you to watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7B85WbEiYf4).


## How to run

To run the program, you need to be inside the project folder and type one of the following lines:

```
python Main.py
# This will create the default 'Expert' Minesweeper level [16x30 cells with 99 bombs]
```
**or**
```
python Main.py x y z
# This will create a Minesweeper game with *x* rows, *y* columns and *z*% of bombs
```
